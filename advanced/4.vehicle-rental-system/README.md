# Vehicle Rental System

This project is a simple web application demonstrating a vehicle rental system using object-oriented programming principles in JavaScript.

## Features

- **Vehicle Hierarchy:** Uses classes (Vehicle, Car, Bike, Scooter, LuxuryCar) with inheritance.
- **Polymorphism:** The `rent()` method is implemented differently in each subclass.
- **Dynamic Display:** Available vehicles are displayed dynamically on the webpage.
- **Rental Form:** Users can select a vehicle and specify the number of rental days.
- **Cost Calculation:** Calculates and displays the total rental cost.
- **Variety of Vehicles:** Includes cars, bikes, scooters, and luxury cars with specific attributes.

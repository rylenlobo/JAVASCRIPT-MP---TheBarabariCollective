# Bookmark Manager

A simple web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to manage their website bookmarks. Users can add new bookmarks with a title, URL, and category, view their saved bookmarks, filter them by category, and delete bookmarks they no longer need. The application uses browser localStorage to persist the bookmarks.

## Features

- **Add Bookmarks:** Easily add new bookmarks by providing a website title, URL, and selecting a category (Work, Study, Entertainment).
- **View Bookmarks:** Displays all saved bookmarks in a clean list format.
- **Filter Bookmarks:** Filter the displayed bookmarks by category (All, Work, Study, Entertainment).
- **Delete Bookmarks:** Remove individual bookmarks with a single click.
- **Persistent Storage:** Bookmarks are saved in the browser's localStorage, so they persist even after closing the browser window.
- **Simple Interface:** Clean and intuitive user interface.
